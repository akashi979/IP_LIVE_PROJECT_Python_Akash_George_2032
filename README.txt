I had prepared the documentation and written the 
code long before but unfortunately at around 7 pm  31/07 the servers were down of the source site DTE
(still down).
 So I had the code but couldn't fetch the final data. As a result, the CSV file wasn't available for 
visualization. I saw a similar case in the workgroup and learned I have to manually prepare a CSV file of 
20 colleges for the visualized report.
